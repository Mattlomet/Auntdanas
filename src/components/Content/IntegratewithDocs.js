      <h3 className="subtitle">
       If billing is done correctly, additional revenue could be achieved in a physician 's practice or outpatient center by IBCLCs collaborating and working with a Pediatrician or OBGYN. 
      </h3>
      <h3 className="subtitle">
       Most services require billing "under"
       or "incident to"
       the Physician so aligning Lactation Consultants with Obstetricians, Pediatricians, Dentists, and other licensed practitioners of Mothers or Babies you can create more dynamic and comprehensive services to breastfeeding dyads.

      So what 's next? 
          </strong>
          <br/>
          You can be a tremendous asset working IN a doctor 's office. To get a foot in the door at a physician'
          s office, you need to talk about shared income and expanding opportunities to help create more comprehensive patient care.
          Due to preventative care mandated by the Affordable Care Act, a collaboration can increase the doctor 's bottom line, increase your income as an IBCLC and help more moms.
